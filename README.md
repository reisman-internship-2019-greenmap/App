# README

The GreenMap app enables you to scan a barcode and learn about who makes the most eco friendly products of that kind. For example, if you walked into a smartphone store and scanner the barcode of a smartphone, we will tell you which smartphone manufactuers make the most eco friendly smartphones. The app is currently in early stages of development.
