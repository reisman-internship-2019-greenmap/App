# README

Branched off of #28, this branch is being used to introduce basic functionality (routing and data flow) into the app's front-end.

### Running the app
1. Clone the repo
2. Open terminal/command prompt
3. cd into the route directory
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `expo start`, `npm start` works too.
6. Proceed as with a normal Expo app (see https://expo.io/learn if you've never used Expo before)

### Current progress:
a basic stackNavigator has been implemented with routes, but no flow has been set up yet.
