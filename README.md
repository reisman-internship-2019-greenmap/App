# README

The GreenMap app enables you to scan a barcode and learn about who makes the most eco friendly products of that kind. For example, if you walked into a smartphone store and scanner the barcode of a smartphone, we will tell you which smartphone manufactuers make the most eco friendly smartphones. The app is currently in early stages of development. 

### Running the app
NOTE: You need to have the Expo CLI installed on your machine to run this app

1. Clone/download this repository 
2. Open terminal/command prompt
3. cd into the route directory
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run 'npm install expo-cli --global'
6. Run `expo start`, `npm start` works too.
7. Proceed as with a normal Expo app (see https://expo.io/learn if you've never used Expo before)

NOTE: The "backend" folder is currently not in use because we are having trouble interacting with a locally running server. We do know that the app can interact with a live server (e.g. http://example.com/movies.json).  When our server is live rather than local we expect less issues.
